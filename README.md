# Home Assistant & Reminder System

### A Firebase/Flutter powered app that demonstrates Data Governance with CloudFirestore, Storage, Serverless CloudFunctions with Firebase Extensions. 

The Home Assistant Scheduler is a proof of concept, expands upon my [Udacity AI Nanodegree Capstone](https://github.com/stigsfoot/Udacity-Nanodegrees/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/capstone).

The Home Assistant & Reminder System is a proof of concept to enable a user (homeowner) to manually log the installation date of maintenance items in a home (internal/external HVAC, roof etc.) through an onboarding flow, see their maintenance reminder preferences listed, and be able to purge that data, including their profile permanently from the system when they need to.

### 3 core objectives

**Authenticate** - Firebase Auth (Email/Google/Anonym)

**Onboarding** - Via the Flutter UI, select their preferences for home artifacts inside and outside their home theyâ€™d like to track. For example HVAC (last serviced, next service), Roof (date installed, next inspection), etc.

**Deletion** - Leverage Firebase Delete User Data extension (Cloud Firestore paths, Recursive) to honor an authenticated users' request to purge their information.
